  "summary": "## COMMUNITY PULSE\n- **xAI turmoil** dominates discussion - half the founding team gone, Musk spinning it as \"push not pull\" but timing suspicious with IPO looming\n- Modal Labs $2.5B valuation raising eyebrows - inference infrastructure getting serious enterprise traction and VC attention\n- OpenAI disbanding mission alignment team + exec firing generating concern about internal culture/direction heading into critical growth phase\n- Salesforce disruption narrative heating up with ex-Founders Fund VC launching AI sales competitor\n- Amazon potentially creating AI training data marketplace catching attention as licensing wars intensify\n\n## KEY DEVELOPMENTS\n- **Modal Labs raising at $2.5B** - AI inference infrastructure space consolidating fast; clients need serverless GPU orchestration and they're paying premium for it\n- **Glean pushing hard for enterprise AI layer ownership** - the \"who owns internal AI context\" battle is real; every enterprise asking this question right now\n- **xAI losing half founding team** despite ambitious plans - talent retention signals matter when evaluating AI vendor stability\n- **OpenAI disbands mission alignment team** - suggests pivot toward pure commercialization over safety theater; changes enterprise risk calculus\n- **Amazon exploring AI training data marketplace** - licensing/rights clearing becoming table stakes for defensible AI implementations\n\n## WHAT THIS MEANS FOR TP\nThe enterprise AI layer battle (Glean, Microsoft, etc.) is where consulting margins live - clients need implementation partners who understand the integration complexity. The xAI chaos and OpenAI policy shifts reinforce that vendor diversification strategies are now mandatory in enterprise AI roadmaps.",
