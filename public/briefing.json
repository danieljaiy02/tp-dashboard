  "summary": "## COMMUNITY PULSE\n(No Reddit/HN discussions provided in data source - check aggregator feeds)\n\n## KEY DEVELOPMENTS\n\n- **xAI bleeding talent**: Half of founding team now departed, with Musk framing exits as \"push not pull\" while pitching interplanetary ambitions at all-hands. Company narrative shifting to moon missions as IPO approaches.\n\n- **Enterprise AI layer battle intensifying**: Glean fighting to own corporate AI infrastructure while Modal Labs raising at $2.5B valuation. Microsoft VP reframing startup economics around AI leverage.\n\n- **OpenAI internal turmoil**: Mission alignment team disbanded, policy exec fired over discrimination claim after opposing adult chatbot modes. Signals potential shift in safety priorities.\n\n- **AI commerce infrastructure emerging**: Amazon reportedly building marketplace for media-to-AI content licensing. Uber Eats launches AI grocery assistant. Infrastructure plays accelerating.\n\n- **Apple continues lagging**: Siri revamp delayed again, widening gap with competitors on consumer AI execution.\n\n## WHAT THIS MEANS FOR TP\n\nEnterprise AI integration (Glean's fight) is where consulting dollars flow—companies need help choosing and implementing these platforms before lock-in happens. xAI chaos and OpenAI safety team changes suggest enterprise clients will increasingly value stability and ethics guidance in vendor selection.",
