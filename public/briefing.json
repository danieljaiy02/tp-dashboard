  "summary": "## COMMUNITY PULSE\n(No Reddit/HN data provided in source material - unable to complete this section with actual community sentiment)\n\n## KEY DEVELOPMENTS\n\n- **xAI hemorrhaging talent** - Half of founding team has now departed, with Musk framing exits as \"push not pull\" while pivoting messaging to interplanetary ambitions and IPO talk\n- **Modal Labs raising at $2.5B valuation** - AI inference infrastructure startup in funding talks, signaling continued investor appetite for picks-and-shovels plays in the AI stack\n- **OpenAI disbands mission alignment team** - Company eliminates dedicated alignment group while also reportedly firing policy exec over discrimination claim related to chatbot content restrictions\n- **Glean fighting for enterprise AI layer** - Company positioning to own the AI interface inside corporations, competing for strategic position between foundation models and end users\n- **Amazon exploring AI content marketplace** - May launch platform for media sites to sell training data to AI companies, potentially standardizing content licensing\n\n## WHAT THIS MEANS FOR TP\n\nThe enterprise AI layer battle (Glean) and infrastructure plays (Modal) confirm what we're seeing: companies want AI capabilities without model complexity. Position TP's automation consulting as the bridge - we help clients implement without betting on volatile vendors. The xAI chaos and OpenAI alignment team dissolution also strengthen the \"build stable internal workflows, don't wait for Big Tech\" narrative.",
